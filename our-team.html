        <div class="team-story">
            <p>Once upon a time in the mystical decade known as the 90s, our lone adventurer, a hero armed only with a mouse and a questionable internet connection, stumbled into the magical world of point-and-click games. Little did they know that those countless hours spent solving pixelated puzzles and navigating quirky characters would plant the seed of a dream: "One day, I shall create my own story!"

                Fast forward through the years, and this brave soul embarked on the ultimate quest: learning how to code... alone. Armed with caffeine, determination, and a collection of browser tabs that would make anyone dizzy, they fought their way through countless tutorials, late-night coding sessions, and the occasional existential crisis ("What even is a semicolon?!").
                
                Despite the struggles, they persevered, driven by the dream of bringing their own world to lifeâ€”a world filled with adventure, emotion, and probably more point-and-click references than you'd expect.
                
                So, here we are, the entire "team" (yes, it's just one person) who somehow turned nostalgia into code. Now, you're invited to join the journey, explore their creation, and dive into the story they have always wanted to tell. And remember, if you ever need to fix a bug in your life, do not forget to try turning it off and on again!</p>
